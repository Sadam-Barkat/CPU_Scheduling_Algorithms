# CPU Scheduling Algorithms in Python

## Overview
This project implements various CPU scheduling algorithms using Python. It features a menu-driven interface where users can select an algorithm and input process details.

## Implemented Algorithms
- First Come, First Serve (FCFS)
- Shortest Job First (SJF)
- Preemptive Shortest Job First (Preemptive SJF)
- Round Robin (RR)
- Priority Scheduling (Non-Preemptive)
- Preemptive Priority Scheduling

## Features
- User-friendly menu interface
- Accepts process ID, burst time, arrival time, and priority (where applicable)
- Computes turnaround time, waiting time, and response time
- Displays Gantt charts for visualization

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Sadam-Barkat/CPU_Scheduling_Algorithms.git
   cd scheduling-algorithms
   ```
2. Run the script:
   ```sh
   python scheduling.py
   ```
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to choose an algorithm and input process details.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
